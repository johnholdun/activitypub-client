# ActivityPub Client

A human-friendly client for any ActivityPub server

## TODO

- Authentication/authorization flow (actor URI and access token; OAuth? IndieAuth?)
- Composer that POSTs to your outbox and offers helpful AS2.0 prefills
- Timeline view that parses your inbox and splits its items into notifications and notes
- Composer shortcuts as reaction links on inbox items?
- RSS view?
